### Anna Hunstig
I am a **Master's student in Mathematics** at the **RWTH Aachen** and am currently writing my thesis **"Koopman Operators for the Optimization of Nonlinear Control Systems"** in Numerical Analysis. 

As soon as I have finished my thesis, you will find the code associated with it on my GitHub. 

I have 2 years of experience as a **research assistant** at the University of Paderborn in the Data Science For Engineering group, 
where I worked on linearization of controlled, optical quantum systems using a **machine learning** approach,
namely Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition to approximate the Koopman Operator. 

This work will be published in the **IEEE CDC24 Proceedings** and afterwards you will find my code for the results here.
